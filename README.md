# PyTorch Linear Regression Model
This is a linear regression model implemented in PyTorch. It takes 80% of the data of a line to train then learns the parameters of the linear equation y = mx + b. It uses an L1 loss function and stochastic gradient descent optimization. After training, it predicts the remaining 20% of the line and visualizes the results.
